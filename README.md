This mod cap production time by putting upper production time limit depending on production time of an item.

**Need to restart the game after MCM config setup for this mod to take effect**

If you are producing more than X number of item per production, production time will be same as if you are producing X amount of item.

**This mod will only effect new production projects and not any ongoing production project.**

i.e if you are producing 40 bandage, and each bandage takes 2 hour to produce.
If you set "Production Speed Cap" to 10, then instead of (40x2) = 80 hours it will take (10x2) = 20 hours.

On any item lower than this cap it should not be effected.

Given that the special ammos and infinite resources of recycler could not be abused due to the slow production speed, this mod should be gamebreaking enough.
